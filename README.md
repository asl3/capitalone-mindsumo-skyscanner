# Capital One Mindsumo Skyscanner Challenge
Developed using React.js with the Skyscanner API (https://rapidapi.com/skyscanner/api/skyscanner-flight-search). 

## Task One: Let users view their flight options between two destinations for specific dates
I completed this task by including text boxes to allow users to input origin location, destination location, outbound date, inbound date, and currency. I then appended these specified path parameters to the API URL in order to query the data corresponding to the user's input.

## Task Two: Allow users to select their currency preference when searching for flights
I completed this task by including a text box to allow users to input their desired currency. I then appended this specified path parameter to the API URL.

## Task Three: Use intuitive UI principles to highlight or call out the cheapest flights for a user running a search
